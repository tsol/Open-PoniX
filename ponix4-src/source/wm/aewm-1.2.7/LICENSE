Portions of the code were originally based on 9wm, which contained
this license:

> 9wm is free software, and is Copyright (c) 1994 by David Hogan.
> Permission is granted to all sentient beings to use this software,
> to make copies of it, and to distribute those copies, provided
> that:
>
>     (1) the copyright and licence notices are left intact
>     (2) the recipients are aware that it is free software
>     (3) any unapproved changes in functionality are either
>           (i) only distributed as patches
>       or (ii) distributed as a new program which is not called 9wm
>               and whose documentation gives credit where it is due
>     (4) the author is not held responsible for any defects
>         or shortcomings in the software, or damages caused by it.
>
> There is no warranty for this software.  Have a nice day.

It is not clear whether this license is legally binding on aewm. I
believe it is not, if clause (3)(ii) is taken literally, but I am
reproducing it for historical purposes. Due to David Hogan's untimely
death, it may be impossible to ever get a definite answer.
