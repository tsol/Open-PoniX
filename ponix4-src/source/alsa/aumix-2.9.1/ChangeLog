$Aumix: aumix/ChangeLog,v 1.101 2010/05/06 03:36:47 trevor Exp $

1993-10-23 - version 0.1

1993-11-28 - version 0.2
- doesn't assume existence of any device (volume, bass, etc.)
- some minor bug fixes
- some bug fixes to work correctly with SB Pro
- should now work correctly when multiple copies are run simultaneously

1996-08-23 - version 1.0
- added command-line interface

1996-09-02 - version 1.1
- fewer colors and no border to simplify full-screen interface
- knobs are highlighted as you move to them, then brighten and
  leave a trail behind when you adjust them
- horizontal knobs drawn with same characters as vertical ones
- vertical controls spaced more closely so they fit in 80 columns
- use of "<" and ">" for cursor motion, and "q" to quit program
- use of tab, "+" and "-" keys shown on help line
- added "h" option for command line

1996-09-07 - version 1.2
- two banks of horizontal controls, no special treatment of
  volume, bass, and treble (layout idea borrowed from CAM), so
  labels don't have to be jammed together
- record/play indicators now show the letters "R" and "P"
  rather than just a red or green square, so they should be
  more self-explanatory and more monochrome-friendly
- added use of "[" and "]" keys to set controls to 0% or 100%

1996-09-13 - version 1.3
- added gpm mouse support by incorporating code from rmev.c by
  Alessandro Rubini (packaged with gpm)
- added Quit button for use with mouse
- changed color of controls from white to cyan/green so the gpm
  cursor would be more visible

  or not in use

1996-12-02 - version 1.4
- added -b, -t, -s, and -m options (Kenn Humborg and Dan Fandrich)
- moved printf statements after the ioctl call, since this makes more
  sense if the ioctl fails (Kenn Humborg)
- changed layout to allow for balance controls, and added them (Trevor Johnson)
- eliminated "level" array: levels are now read by ioctl so changes by other
  processes system-wide will be properly reflected (Trevor Johnson)
- conditional compilation: GPM now optional, and interactive mode can be
  disabled entirely (Trevor Johnson)

1996-12-06 - version 1.5
- "q" options for command line to print settings without changing (Jeff Spirko)
- command-line section modularized for compactness (Trevor Johnson)

  reading (Trevor Johnson)

  line2 and line3 (Trevor Johnson)

1996-12-15 - version 1.6
- ability to save settings to a file and load them in again
- option to use a restricted character set in interactive mode, when IBM
  graphic characters are not available
- support for second mixer
- changed meaning of "<" and ">" keys (now same as Tab or Enter)
- "," and "." function synonymously with "<" and ">" so users need not shift
  when using US keyboard
- prettified device names removed, to save space and to allow for future
  changes to the sound driver
- added labels for banks of level and balance controls
- record/play information updated more often
- record/play information gets printed on query

1996-12-17 - version 1.6.1
- fixed problem with conditional compilation

1997-05-30 - version 1.7
