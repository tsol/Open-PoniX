The core X protocol makes no guarantees about the relative order of execution
of requests for different clients. This means that any synchronization between
clients must be done at the client level in an operating system-dependent and
network-dependent manner. Even if there was an accepted standard for such
synchronization, the use of a network introduces unpredictable delays between
the synchronization of the clients and the delivery of the resulting requests
to the X server.
</p><p>
The core X protocol also makes no guarantees about the time at which requests
are executed, which means that all clients with real-time constraints must
implement their timing on the host computer. Any such timings are subject to
error introduced by delays within the operating system and network and are
inefficient because of the need for round-trip requests that keep the client
and server synchronized.
</p><p>
The synchronization extension provides primitives that allow synchronization
between clients to take place entirely within the X server. This removes any
error introduced by the network and makes it possible to synchronize clients
on different hosts running different operating systems. This is important for
multimedia applications, where audio, video, and graphics data streams are
being synchronized.  The extension also provides internal timers within the
X server to which client requests can be synchronized. This allows simple
animation applications to be implemented without any round-trip requests and
makes best use of buffering within the client, network, and server.
</p><div class="sect1" title="Description"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a id="Description"></a>Description</h2></div></div></div><p>
The mechanism used by this extension for synchronization within the X
server is to block the processing of requests from a client until a
specific synchronization condition occurs. When the condition occurs, the
client is released and processing of requests continues. Multiple clients
may block on the same condition to give inter-client synchronization.
Alternatively, a single client may block on a condition such as an animation
frame marker.
</p><p>
The extension adds <code class="function">Counter</code>, <code class="function">Alarm</code>,
and <code class="function">Fence</code> to the set of resources managed by the
server. A counter has a 64-bit integer value that may be increased or
decreased by client requests or by the server internally. A client can block
by sending an Await request that waits until one of a set of synchronization
conditions, called TRIGGERs, becomes TRUE.  Alarms generate events when
counter values go through a specified transition.  A fence has two possible
states: triggered and not triggered. Client requests can put the fence in
either of these states. A client can block until one of a set of fences
becomes triggered by sending an AwaitFence request.  Fences are bound to a
particular screen at creation time.
</p><p>
The <code class="function">CreateCounter</code> request allows a client to create a
<code class="function">Counter</code> that can be changed by explicit
<code class="function">SetCounter</code> and <code class="function">ChangeCounter</code>
requests. These can be used to implement synchronization between different
clients.
</p><p>
There are some counters, called <code class="function">System Counters</code>, that
are changed by the server internally rather than by client requests. The
effect of any change to a system counter is not visible until the server
has finished processing the current request. In other words, system
counters are apparently updated in the gaps between the execution of
requests rather than during the actual execution of a request. The extension
provides a system counter that advances with the server time as defined by
the core protocol, and it may also provide counters that advance with the
real-world time or that change each time the CRT screen is refreshed.
Other extensions may provide their own extension-specific system counters.
</p><p>
The extension provides an <code class="function">Alarm</code> mechanism that allows
clients to receive an event on a regular basis when a particular counter
is changed.
</p><p>
The <code class="function">CreateFence</code> request allows a client to create a
<code class="function">Fence</code> that can be triggered and reset using
<code class="function">TriggerFence</code> and <code class="function">ResetFence</code>
requests, respectively.  <code class="function">CreateFence</code> takes a drawable
argument that implies which screen the fence should be created on.  The
<code class="function">TriggerFence</code> request changes the fence's state only
after all previous rendering commands affecting objects owned by the given
fence's screen have completed.  Note that while fence objects are bound
to a screen and the simple trigger operation provided by this extension
operates at screen granularity, other extensions may add more fine-grained
trigger operations based on any number of events.  The screen binding
merely establishes an upper bound for the scope of fence operations.

Please refer to the X11 Protocol specification as this document uses

</p><p>The following new types are used by the extension.</p><pre class="literallayout">

                        wait-value:INT64,
                        test-type:TESTTYPE
                       ]
WAITCONDITION:         [
                        trigger:TRIGGER,

                        name:STRING8,

                        resolution:INT64
                       ]
ALARM:                 XID
ALARMSTATE:            {Active,Inactive,Destroyed}
FENCE:                 XID
</pre><p>
The COUNTER type defines the client-side handle on a server
<code class="function">Counter</code>. The value of a counter is an INT64.
</p><p>
The TRIGGER type defines a test on a counter that is either TRUE or FALSE. The
value of the test is determined by the combination of a test value, the value
of the counter, and the specified test-type.
</p><p>
The test value for a trigger is calculated using the value-type and
wait-value fields when the trigger is initialized. If the value-type field
is not one of the named VALUETYPE constants, the request that initialized the
trigger will return a <code class="function">Value</code> error. If the value-type
field is <code class="function">Absolute</code>, the test value is given by the
wait-value field. If the value-type field is <code class="function">Relative</code>,
the test value is obtained by adding the wait-value field to the value of the
counter. If the resulting test value would lie outside the range for an
INT64, the request that initialized the trigger will return a
<code class="function">Value</code> error. If counter is <code class="function">None</code>
and the value-type is <code class="function">Relative</code>, the request that
initialized the trigger will return a <code class="function">Match</code> error. If
counter is not None and does not name a valid counter, a Counter error is
generated.
</p><p>
If the test-type is <code class="function">PositiveTransition</code>, the trigger is
initialized to FALSE, and it will become TRUE when the counter changes from
a value less than the test value to a value greater than or equal to the
test value. If the test-type is <code class="function">NegativeTransition</code>,
the trigger is initialize to FALSE, and it will become TRUE when the counter
changes from a value greater than the test value to a value less than or
equal to the test value. If the test-type is
<code class="function">PositiveComparison</code>, the trigger is TRUE if the
counter is greater than or equal to the test value and FALSE otherwise. If the
test-type is <code class="function">NegativeComparison</code>, the trigger is TRUE
if the counter is less than or equal to the test value and FALSE otherwise.
If the test-type is not one of the named TESTTYPE constants, the request that
initialized the trigger will return a Value error. A trigger with a counter
value of <code class="function">None</code> and a valid test-type is always TRUE.
</p><p>
The WAITCONDITION type is simply a trigger with an associated event-threshold.
The event threshold is used by the <code class="function">Await</code> request to
decide whether or not to generate an event to the client after the trigger has
become TRUE. By setting the event-threshold to an appropriate value, it is
possible to detect the situation where an <code class="function">Await</code> request
was processed after the TRIGGER became TRUE, which usually indicates that
the server is not processing requests as fast as the client expects.
</p><p>
The SYSTEMCOUNTER type provides the client with information about a
<code class="function">System</code>Counter. The name field is the textual name of
the counter that identifies the counter to the client. The counter field
is the client-side handle that should be used in requests that require a
counter. The resolution field gives the approximate step size of the system
counter. This is a hint to the client
that the extension may not be able to resolve two wait conditions with test
values that differ by less than this step size. A microsecond clock, for
example, may advance in steps of 64 microseconds, so a counter based on this
clock would have a resolution of 64.
</p><p>
The only system counter that is guaranteed to be present is called SERVERTIME,
which counts milliseconds from some arbitrary starting point. The least
significant 32 bits of this counter track the value of Time used by the
server in Events and Requests. Other system counters may be provided by
different implementations of the extension. The X Consortium will maintain a
registry of system counter names to avoid collisions in the name space.
</p><p>
An ALARM is the client-side handle on an <code class="function">Alarm</code> resource.
</p><p>
The FENCE type defines the client-side handle on a server
<code class="function">Fence</code>.  A fence can only be in one of two states,
represented by a BOOL.  If the value is TRUE, the fence is in the triggered
state.  Otherwise, the fence is in the not triggered state.

This request must be executed before any other requests for this extension. If a
client violates this rule, the results of all SYNC requests that it issues are
undefined. The request takes the version number of the extension that the
client wishes to use and returns the actual version number being implemented
by the extension for this client. The extension may return different
version numbers to a client depending of the version number supplied by
that client. This request should be executed only once for each client
connection.
     </p><p>
Given two different versions of the SYNC protocol, v1 and v2, v1 is
compatible with v2 if and only if v1.version_major = v2.version_major
and v1.version_minor &lt;= v2.version_minor.  Compatible means that the
functionality is fully supported in an identical fashion in the two versions.

When this request is executed, the triggers in the wait-list are initialized
using the wait-value and value-type fields, as described in the definition of
TRIGGER above. The processing of further requests for the client is blocked
until one or more of the triggers becomes TRUE. This may happen immediately,
as a result of the initialization, or at some later time, as a result of
a subsequent <code class="function">SetCounter</code>,
<code class="function">ChangeCounter</code> or
<code class="function">DestroyCounter</code> request.
      </p><p>
A Value error is generated if wait-list is empty.
      </p><p>
When the client becomes unblocked, each trigger is checked to determine
whether a <code class="function">CounterNotify</code> event should be generated.
The difference between the counter and the test value is calculated by
subtracting the test value from the value of the counter. If the test-type
is <code class="function">PositiveTransition</code> or
<code class="function">PositiveComparison</code>, a
<code class="function">CounterNotify</code> event is generated if the difference is
at least event-threshold. If the test-type is
<code class="function">NegativeTransition</code> or
<code class="function">NegativeComparison</code>, a
<code class="function">CounterNotify</code> event is generated if the difference
is at most event-threshold. If the difference lies outside the range for an
INT64, an event is not generated.
      </p><p>
This threshold check is made for each trigger in the list and a
<code class="function">CounterNotify</code> event is generated for every trigger for
which the check succeeds. The check for
<code class="function">CounterNotify</code> events is performed even if one of the
triggers is TRUE when the request is first executed. Note that a
<code class="function">CounterNotify</code> event may be generated for a trigger
that is FALSE if there are multiple triggers in the request. A
<code class="function">CounterNotify</code> event with the destroyed flag set to
TRUE is always generated if the counter for one of the triggers is

<code class="function">CounterNotify</code> events may be generated. If the change to
the counter satisfies the trigger for an alarm, an
<code class="function">AlarmNotify</code> event is generated and the

counter is a system counter. A <code class="function">Counter</code> error is
generated if counter does not name a valid counter. If the resulting value
for the counter would be outside the range for an INT64, a

Whenever the trigger becomes TRUE, either as a result of this request or as the
result of a <code class="function">SetCounter</code>,
<code class="function">ChangeCounter</code>, <code class="function">DestroyCounter</code>, or
<code class="function">ChangeAlarm</code> request, an
<code class="function">AlarmNotify</code> event is generated and the alarm is
updated. The alarm is updated by repeatedly adding delta to the value of the
trigger and reinitializing it until it becomes FALSE. If this update would
cause value to fall outside the range for an INT64, or if the counter
value is <code class="function">None</code>, or if the delta is 0 and test-type
is <code class="function">PositiveComparison</code> or
<code class="function">NegativeComparison</code>, no change is made to value and
the alarm state is changed to <code class="function">Inactive</code> before the
event is generated. No further events are generated by an
<code class="function">Inactive</code> alarm until a <code class="function">ChangeAlarm</code>

The events value enables or disables delivery of

An <code class="function">AlarmNotify</code> event is always generated at some time

This request changes the scheduling priority of the client that created

the priority for the client making the request is changed. A
<code class="function">Match</code> error is generated if client-resource is not

The priority of a client is set to 0 when the initial client connection is
 made.
      </p><p>
The effect of different client priorities depends on the particular
implementation of the extension, and in some cases it may have no effect at
all. However, the intention is that higher priority clients will have
their requests executed before those of lower priority clients.
      </p><p>
For most animation applications, it is desirable that animation clients be
given priority over nonrealtime clients. This improves the smoothness of the
animation on a loaded server. Because a server is free to implement very strict
priorities, processing requests for the highest priority client to the
exclusion of all others, it is important that a client that may potentially
monopolize the whole server, such as an animation that produces continuous
output as fast as it can with no rate control, is run at low rather than high
priority.
