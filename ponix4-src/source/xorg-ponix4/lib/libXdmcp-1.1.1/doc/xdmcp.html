The purpose of the X Display Manager Control Protocol (XDMCP)
is to provide a uniform mechanism for an autonomous
display to request login service from a remote host.
By autonomous, we mean
the display consists of hardware and processes that are independent of any
particular host where login service is desired.  (For example, the server
cannot simply be started by a
<code class="function">fork/exec</code>
sequence on the host.)
An X terminal (screen, keyboard, mouse, processor, network interface)
is a prime example of an autonomous display.
</p><p>
From the point of view of the end user, it is very important to make
autonomous displays as easy to use as traditional hardwired character
terminals.  Specifically, you can typically just power on a hardwired
terminal and be greeted with a login prompt.  The same should be possible
with autonomous displays.  However, in a network environment with multiple
hosts, the end user may want to choose which host(s) to connect to.  In an
environment with many displays and many hosts, a site administrator may want
to associate particular collections of hosts with particular displays.  We
would like to support the following options:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>
The display has a single, fixed host to which it should connect.  It should be
possible to power on the display and receive a login prompt, without user
intervention.
    </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
Any one of several hosts on a network or subnetwork may be acceptable
for accepting login from the display.
(For example, the user's file systems can be mounted onto
any such host, providing comparable environments.)  It should be possible
for the display to broadcast to find such hosts and to have the display
either automatically choose a host or present the possible hosts to the
user for selection.
    </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
The display has a fixed set of hosts that it can connect to.  It should be
possible for the display to have that set stored in RAM, but it should also be
possible for a site administrator to be able to maintain host sets for a
large number of displays using a centralized facility, without having to
interact (physically or electronically) with each individual display.
Particular hosts should be allowed to refuse login service, based on
whatever local criteria are desired.
    </p></li></ul></div><p>
The control protocol should be designed in such a way that it can be used over
a reasonable variety of communication transport layers.  In fact, it is quite
desirable if every major network protocol family that supports the standard X
protocol is also capable of supporting XDMCP, because the end result of XDMCP
negotiation will be standard X protocol connections to the display.
However, because the number of displays per host may be large,
a connection-based protocol appears less desirable
than a connection-less protocol.  For this reason the protocol is designed
to use datagram services with the display responsible for sequencing and
retransmission.
</p><p>

To keep the burden on displays at a minimum (because display cost is not
a factor that can be ignored), it is desirable that displays not be required
to maintain permanent state (across power cycles) for the purposes
of the control protocol,
and it is desirable to keep required state at a minimum while the
display is powered on.
</p><p>

Security is an important consideration and must be an integral part of the
design.  The important security goals in the context of XDMCP are:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>
It should be possible for the display to verify that it is communicating
with a legitimate host login service.  Because the user will present
credentials (for example, password) to this service,
it is important to avoid spoof attacks.
    </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
It should be possible for the display and the login service to negotiate the
authorization mechanism to be used for the standard X protocol.
    </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
It should be possible to provide the same level of security in verifying the
login service as is provided by the negotiated authorization mechanism.
    </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
Because there are no firm standards yet in the area of security,
XDMCP must be flexible enough to accomodate a variety of security mechanisms.
    </p></li></ul></div></div><div class="chapter" title="Chapter 2. Overview of the Protocol"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="Overview_of_the_Protocol"></a>Chapter 2. Overview of the Protocol</h2></div></div></div><p>

XDMCP is designed to provide authenticated access to display management
services for remote displays.  A new network server, called a \fIDisplay
Manager\fP, will use XDMCP to communicate with displays to negotiate the
startup of X sessions.  The protocol allows the display to authenticate the
manager.  It also allows most of the configuration information to be
centralized with the manager and to ease the burden of system administration
in a large network of displays.
The essential goal is to provide plug-and-play
services similar to those provided in the familiar mainframe/terminal world.
</p><p>

Displays may be turned off by the user at any time.  Any existing session
running on a display that has been turned off must be identifiable.  This
is made possible by requiring a three-way handshake to start a session.  If
the handshake succeeds, any existing session is terminated immediately and a
new session started.  There is the problem (at least with TCP) that
connections may not be closed when the display is turned off.  In most
environments, the manager should reduce this problem by periodically XSync'ing
on its own connection, perhaps every five to ten minutes, and terminating the
session if its own connection ever closes.
</p><p>

Displays should not be required to retain permanent state for purposes of
the control protocol.  One solution to packets received out of sequence
would be to use monotonically increasing message identifiers in each message
to allow both sides to ignore messages that arrive out-of-sequence.  For
this to work, displays would at a minimum have to increment a stable crash
count each time they are powered on and use that number as part of a
larger sequence number.  But if displays cannot retain permanent state this
cannot work.  Instead, the manager assumes the responsibility for permanent
state by generating unique numbers that identify a particular session and
the protocol simply ignores packets that correspond to an invalid session.
</p><p>

The Manager must not be responsible for packet reception.  To prevent the
Manager from becoming stuck because of a hostile display, no portion of the
protocol requires the Manager to retransmit a packet.  Part of this means
that any valid packet that the Manager does receive must be
acknowledged in some way to prevent the display from continuously resending
packets.  The display can keep the protocol running as it will always know
when the Manager has received (at least one copy of) a packet.  On the
Manager side, this means that any packet may be received more than once (if
the response was lost) and duplicates must be ignored.
</p></div><div class="chapter" title="Chapter 3. Data Types"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="Data_Types"></a>Chapter 3. Data Types</h2></div></div></div><p>

XDMCP packets contain several types of data.  Integer values are always
stored most significant byte first in the packet ("Big Endian" order).
As XDMCP will not be used to transport large quantities of data, this
restriction will not substantially hamper the efficiency of any
implementation.  Also, no padding of any sort will occur within the packets.

A <code class="function">Query</code>
packet is sent from the display to a specific host to ask if
that host is willing to provide management services to this display.  The
host should respond with
<code class="function">Willing</code>

<code class="function">Unwilling</code>

An
<code class="function">IndirectQuery</code>
packet is sent to a well known manager that forwards
the request to a larger collection of secondary managers using
<code class="function">ForwardQuery</code>
packets.
In this way, the collection of managers that respond can be grouped
on other than network boundaries; the use of a central manager reduces
system administrative overhead.
The primary manager may also send a
<code class="function">Willing</code>
packet in response to this packet.

Each packet type has slightly different semantics:

The
<code class="function">Query</code>
packet is destined only for a single host.
If the display is instructed to
<code class="function">Query</code>
multiple managers, it will send multiple
<code class="function">Query</code>
packets.  The
<code class="function">Query</code>
packet also demands a response from the manager, either
<code class="function">Willing</code>
or
<code class="function">Unwilling</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
The
<code class="function">BroadcastQuery</code>
packet is sent to many hosts.
Each manager that receives this packet will not respond with an
<code class="function">Unwilling</code>
packet.
    </p>
    <p>
The
<code class="function">IndirectQuery</code>
packet is sent to only one manager with the request
that the request be forwarded to a larger list of managers using
<code class="function">ForwardQuery</code>
packets.  This list is expected to be maintained at one
central site to reduce administrative overhead.
The function of this packet type is similar to
<code class="function">BroadcastQuery except that</code>
<code class="function">BroadcastQuery</code>
is not forwarded.

When XDMCP is implemented on top of the Internet User Datagram Protocol (UDP),
port number 177 is to be used. When using UDP over IPv4, Broadcast Query
packets are sent via UDP broadcast.  When using UDP over IPv6, Broadcast Query
packets are sent via multicast, either to an address in the IANA registered
XDMCP multicast address range of
FF0<span class="emphasis"><em>X</em></span>:0:0:0:0:0:0:12B
(where the <span class="emphasis"><em>X</em></span> is replaced by a valid scope id)
or to a locally assigned
multicast address. The version number in all packets will be 1.
Packet opcodes are 16-bit integers.

The Display Class field of the
<code class="function">Manage</code>
packet is used by the display manager to collect common sorts of
displays into manageable groups.  This field is a string encoded of
ISO-LATIN-1 characters in the following format:
</p><pre class="literallayout">
<span class="emphasis"><em>ManufacturerID</em></span>-<span class="emphasis"><em>ModelNumber</em></span>
</pre><p>
Both elements of this string must exclude characters of the set
{ <code class="function">-</code>,
<code class="function">.</code>,
<code class="function">:</code>,
<code class="function">*</code>,
<code class="function">?</code>,
<span class="emphasis"><em>&lt;space&gt;</em></span> }.
The ManufacturerID is a string that should be registered
with the X Consortium.
The ModelNumber is designed to identify characteristics of the display
within the manufacturer's product line.
This string should be documented in the users manual for the
particular device and  should probably not be specifiable by the
display user to avoid unexpected configuration errors.
</p></div><div class="chapter" title="Chapter 10. Manufacturer Display ID Format"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="Manufacturer_Display_ID_Format"></a>Chapter 10. Manufacturer Display ID Format</h2></div></div></div><p>
To authenticate the manager, the display and manager will share a private
key.
The manager, then, must be able to discover which key to use for a
particular device.
The Manufacturer Display ID field of the
<code class="function">Request</code>
packet is intended for this purpose.  Typically, the manager host will
contain a map between this number and the key.  This field is intended to be
unique per display, possibly the ethernet address of the display in the form:
</p><pre class="literallayout">
-Ethernet-8:0:2b:a:f:d2
</pre><p>
It can also be a string of the form:
</p><pre class="literallayout">
<span class="emphasis"><em>ManufacturerID</em></span>-<span class="emphasis"><em>ModelNumber</em></span>-<span class="emphasis"><em>SerialNumber</em></span>
</pre><p>
The ManufacturerID, ModelNumber and SerialNumber are encoded using
ISO-LATIN-1 characters, excluding {
<code class="function">-</code>,
<code class="function">.</code>,
<code class="function">*</code>,
<code class="function">?</code>,
<span class="emphasis"><em>&lt;space&gt;</em></span> }
</p><p>
When the display is shipped to a customer, it should include both the
Manufacturer Display ID and the private key in the documentation set.
This information should not be modifiable by the display user.
</p></div><div class="chapter" title="Chapter 11. Authentication"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="Authentication"></a>Chapter 11. Authentication</h2></div></div></div><p>
In an environment where authentication is not needed, XDMCP can disable
authentication by having the display send empty Authentication Name
and Authentication Data fields in the
<code class="function">Request</code>
packet.
In this case, the manager will not attempt to authenticate itself.
Other authentication protocols may be developed, depending on local needs.
</p><p>
In an unsecure environment, the display must be able to verify that the
source of the various packets is a trusted manager.  These packets will
contain authentication information.  As an example of such a system, the
following discussion describes the "XDM-AUTHENTICATION-1" authentication
system.  This system uses a 56-bit shared private key, and 64 bits of
authentication data.  An associated example X authorization protocol
"XDM-AUTHORIZATION-1" will also be discussed.  The 56-bit key is represented
as a 64-bit number in network order (big endian).  This means that the first
octet in the representation will be zero.  When incrementing a 64-bit value,
the 8 octets of data will be interpreted in network order (big endian).
That is, the last octet will be incremented, subsequent carries propogate
towards the first octet.
</p><p>
Assumptions:
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>
The display and manager share a private key.  This key could be programmed
into the display by the manufacturer and shipped with the unit.  It must not
be available from the display itself, but should allow the value to be
modified in some way.  The system administrator would be responsible for
managing a database of terminal keys.
    </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
The display can generate random authentication numbers.
    </p></li></ol></div><p>
Some definitions first:

Encryption will use the Data Encryption Standard (DES, FIPS 46-3); blocks
shorter than 64 bits will be zero-filled
on the right to 64 bits.  Blocks longer than 64 bits will use block chaining:
</p><p>
{<span class="italic">D</span>}<sup><span class="italic">κ</span></sup> = {<span class="italic">D</span><sub>1</sub>}<sup><span class="italic">κ</span></sup> {<span class="italic">D</span><sub>2</sub> xor {<span class="italic">D</span><sub>1</sub>}<sup><span class="italic">κ</span></sup>}<sup><span class="italic">κ</span></sup>
</p><p>
The display generates the first authentication data in the
<code class="function">Request</code>
packet:
</p><p>
<span class="italic">α</span><sub>Request</sub> = {<span class="italic">ρ</span>}<sup><span class="italic">τ</span></sup>
</p><p>
For the <code class="function">Accept</code>
packet, the manager decrypts the initial message and returns
<span class="italic">α</span><sub>Accept</sub>:

</p><p>
<span class="italic">ρ</span> = {<span class="italic">α</span><sub>Request</sub>}*<sup><span class="italic">τ</span></sup>
</p><p>
<span class="italic">α</span><sub>Accept</sub> = { <span class="italic">ρ</span> + 1}<sup><span class="italic">τ</span></sup>
</p><p>
The <code class="function">Accept</code>
packet also contains the authorization intended for use by
the X server.  A description of authorization type "XDM-AUTHORIZATION-1"
follows.
</p><p>
The <code class="function">Accept</code>
packet contains the authorization name
"XDM-AUTHORIZATION-1".  The authorization data is the string:
</p><p>
<span class="italic">β</span><sub>Accept</sub> = {<span class="italic">σ</span>}<sup><span class="italic">τ</span></sup>
</p><p>
To create authorization information for connection setup with the X server
using the XDM-AUTHORIZATION-1 authorization protocol, the client computes the
following:
</p><p>
<span class="italic">N</span> = X client identifier
</p><p>
<span class="italic">T</span> = Current time in seconds on client host (32 bits)
</p><p>
<span class="italic">β</span> = {<span class="italic">ρ</span><span class="italic">N</span><span class="italic">T</span>}<sup><span class="italic">σ</span></sup>
</p><p>
For TCP connections <span class="italic">N</span> is 48 bits long and contains the 32-bit IPv4 address of
the client host followed by the 16-bit port number of the client socket.
Formats for other connections must be registered.
The resulting value, <span class="italic">β</span>, is 192 bits of authorization data that is sent
in the connection setup to the server.  The server receives the packet,
decrypts the contents.  To accept the connection, the following must hold:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>
<span class="italic">ρ</span> must match the value generated for the most recent XDMCP negotiation.
    </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
<span class="italic">T</span> must be within 1200 seconds of the internally stored time.  If no time
been received before, the current time is set to <span class="italic">T</span>.
    </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
No packet containing the same pair (<span class="italic">N</span>, <span class="italic">T</span>) can have been received
in the last 1200 seconds (20 minutes).
    </p></li></ul></div></div></div></body></html>
