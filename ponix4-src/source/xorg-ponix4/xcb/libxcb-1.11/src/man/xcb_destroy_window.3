.SH REQUEST ARGUMENTS
.IP \fIconn\fP 1i
The XCB connection to X11.
.IP \fIwindow\fP 1i
The window to destroy.
.SH DESCRIPTION
Destroys the specified window and all of its subwindows. A DestroyNotify event
is generated for each destroyed window (a DestroyNotify event is first generated
for any given window's inferiors). If the window was mapped, it will be
automatically unmapped before destroying.

Calling DestroyWindow on the root window will do nothing.
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns an \fIxcb_void_cookie_t\fP. Errors (if any) have to be handled in the event loop.

If you want to handle errors directly with \fIxcb_request_check\fP instead, use \fIxcb_destroy_window_checked\fP. See \fBxcb-requests(3)\fP for details.
.SH ERRORS
.IP \fIxcb_window_error_t\fP 1i
The specified window does not exist.
