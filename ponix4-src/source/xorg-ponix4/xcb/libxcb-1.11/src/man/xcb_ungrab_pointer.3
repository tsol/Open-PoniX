.SH REQUEST ARGUMENTS
.IP \fIconn\fP 1i
The XCB connection to X11.
.IP \fItime\fP 1i
Timestamp to avoid race conditions when running X over the network.

The pointer will not be released if \fItime\fP is earlier than the
last-pointer-grab time or later than the current X server time.
.SH DESCRIPTION
Releases the pointer and any queued events if you actively grabbed the pointer
before using \fIxcb_grab_pointer\fP, \fIxcb_grab_button\fP or within a normal button
press.

EnterNotify and LeaveNotify events are generated.
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns an \fIxcb_void_cookie_t\fP. Errors (if any) have to be handled in the event loop.

If you want to handle errors directly with \fIxcb_request_check\fP instead, use \fIxcb_ungrab_pointer_checked\fP. See \fBxcb-requests(3)\fP for details.
.SH ERRORS
This request does never generate any errors.
