.SH EVENT FIELDS
.IP \fIresponse_type\fP 1i
The type of this event, in this case \fIXCB_UNMAP_NOTIFY\fP. This field is also present in the \fIxcb_generic_event_t\fP and can be used to tell events apart from each other.
.IP \fIsequence\fP 1i
The sequence number of the last request processed by the X11 server.
.IP \fIevent\fP 1i
The reconfigured window or its parent, depending on whether \fIStructureNotify\fP
or \fISubstructureNotify\fP was selected.
.IP \fIwindow\fP 1i
The window that was unmapped.
.IP \fIfrom_configure\fP 1i
Set to 1 if the event was generated as a result of a resizing of the window's
parent when \fIwindow\fP had a win_gravity of \fIUnmapGravity\fP.
