USB Redirector for Linux v3.1
-----------------------------------------------------------


1. Software requirements.
----------------------

USB Redirector can be installed on the computer with Linux,
which has a kernel version 2.6.15 or newer.

Some   components   of   USB  Redirector  are  operating  in
kernel-mode.  They  need to be compiled specifically for the
Linux  kernel  where  they  will run. Usually, the installer
will  compile  them  automatically.  If it fails to do this,
please   make  sure  that  the  following  requirements  are
satisfied:

1. 'make' is installed.
2. 'gcc' is installed.
3. Kernel  sources or kernel headers are installed and they
   correspond to the running kernel.

By  default,  the  installer will look for kernel sources in
/lib/modules/`uname -r`/build.   If   they  are  located  in
another  directory, you'll need to change the following line
in installer.sh to point to your kernel sources:

# Default kernel sources path
KERNELDIR=/lib/modules/`uname -r`/build


2. USB Redirector installation.
---------------------------

To  install  USB  Redirector  please run installation script
installer.sh  with   "install-client",   "install-server" or
"install"  parameter,  depending  on  your requirements. The
script   is   located   in   the    root   folder   of   USB
Redirector  package.   Installation    script  will  install
USB  Redirector to your computer.


3. USB Redirector uninstallation.
-----------------------------

To uninstall USB Redirector please run uninstall.sh script.
It  is  located  in  the directory where USB Redirector was
installed. By default it is /usr/local/usb-redirector.


4. Using USB Redirector
-----------------------------

To  start  using  USB  Redirector  you  may try to enter the
following commands in your command line (without quotes):

`usbsrv` - if you installed it in USB server mode;
`usbclnt` - if you installed in USB client mode.


5. Manual driver compilation.
----------------------------

If your kernel sources are located on another machine or you
need  to cross-compile the driver, you'll have to compile it
manually.

Driver sources are located in ./files/modules/src/tusbd

To  compile the driver you need to have source codes of your
Linux  kernel.  Default  Makefile  is  searching  for kernel
source code in "/lib/modules/`uname -r`/build" directory. If
your   kernel   is  in  the  other  directory  you can point
its location using KERNELDIR variable,

e.g.: make KERNELDIR=/usr/src/kernel-source-2.6.17.5

After successful driver compilation there will be tusbd.ko
file  in  the "./files/modules/src/tusbd"  directory.  
This file is necessary for USB Redirector operation.
